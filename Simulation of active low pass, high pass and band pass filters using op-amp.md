## EC1421-19EC421-Analysis-and-Design-of-Analog-ICs
## Simulation of active low pass, high pass and band pass filters using op-amp.

## AIM:

To Design and simulate the following circuits using LT-Spice 
a. Active low pass filter 
b. Active high pass filter 
c. Active band pass filter

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
1. Double click on LT-Spice icon.
2. New schematic window open.
3. Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram.
4. Complete the connection.
5. Save the file by giving file name.
6. Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.
7. Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtai

## CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:

### LOWPASS FILTER CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:


### HIGHPASS FILTER CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:


### BANDPASS FILTER CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:





## OUTPUT GRAPH:

### LOWPASS FILTER:

### HIGHPASS FILTER:

### BANDPASS FILTER:

## RESULT:
Thus the LT-SPICE tool has been studied and active low pass filter, high pass and band pass filter is simulated.
